# ZNPCsPlus
[ZNPCsPlus](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/znpcsplus.109380/) is an unofficial fork of the popular NPC plugin ZNPCs written with the Spigot/Bukkit API originally made by 
gonalez/ZNetwork. This fork was made because the original maintainer of the plugin decided to announce that he was 
[dropping support for the plugin](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1093914615873806477/1098409384855474237/znpc.png) 
in the original project's [official discord server](https://discord.com/invite/RhNMH4T).

### Dependencies
- Java 8
- Spigot 1.8 - 1.19.4
- PlaceholderAPI (OPTIONAL)

## Why is it better?
This fork makes several improvements over the original including:
- More performance-conscious code
- Latest version support (1.19.4)
- Fixes for long-running issues of the original plugin (ones that the original maintainer refused to even acknowledge)
